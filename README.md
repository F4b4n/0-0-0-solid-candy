# solid-candy
This is my pet project on the square to have fun with solid and build a site for "my" rescued cat (btw, I'm a dog person 0_0)

## Story
Me and my fiance adopted an almost 2 years old rescued cat from [Tomasina Cat Sanctuary](http://tomasinasanctuary.org/) on the 2nd of August in 2023

## Goals
The main goal of the website is to use, practice solidjs (consider me as a Ryan Carniato fanboy) and who cares if in the meantime an educational/charity site becomes live :)
