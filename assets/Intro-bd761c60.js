I’m a calico cat who loves to sleep, play, and watch the world go by. I’m so happy to have found my forever home with my loving humans. They adopted me from a sanctuary where I was brought after being rescued from a field. I had a rough start in life, but now I’m living the sweet life!","On this page, you can see some of my photos, videos, and stories. You can also learn more about me and my personality. I’m very smart, kind, and gentle. I love to get pets and cuddles from my humans. I also like to run around and chase my mouse toys or their hair ties. Sometimes I do a funny death drop when they pet me. It makes their hearts melt and they shower me with more love.","I hope you enjoy my page and follow me on my adventures. I’m always curious and eager to explore new things. For example, I recently discovered the joys of climbing on the curtains and hiding under the sofa cushions. I also like to make new friends, so feel free to leave me a comment or a message. I’ll try to reply as soon as I can. Thank you for visiting and have a purr-fect day! 🐱"],c=t("<div>"),u=t("<p>");function f(){return(()=>{const e=c();return a(e,r(s,{each:d,children:n=>(()=>{const o=u();return a(o,n),o})()})),m(()=>i(e,h.intro)),e})()}export{f as default};
