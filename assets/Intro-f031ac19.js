I‚Äôm a calico cat who loves to sleep, play, and watch the world go by. I‚Äôm so happy to have found my forever home with my loving humans. They adopted me from a sanctuary where I was brought after being rescued from a field. I had a rough start in life, but now I‚Äôm living the sweet life!","On this page, you can see some of my photos, videos, and stories. You can also learn more about me and my personality. I‚Äôm very smart, kind, and gentle. I love to get pets and cuddles from my humans. I also like to run around and chase my mouse toys or their hair ties. Sometimes I do a funny death drop when they pet me. It makes their hearts melt and they shower me with more love.","I hope you enjoy my page and follow me on my adventures. I‚Äôm always curious and eager to explore new things. For example, I recently discovered the joys of climbing on the kitchen shelves and hiding under the sofa cushions. Thank you for visiting and have a purr-fect day! üê±"],c=a("<div>"),u=a("<p>");function p(){return(()=>{const e=c();return t(e,r(s,{each:d,children:n=>(()=>{const o=u();return t(o,n),o})()})),i(()=>m(e,l.intro)),e})()}export{p as default};
