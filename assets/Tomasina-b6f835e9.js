It all started when I was living in a field at Bidnija, trying to survive on my own. I had babies, but I don’t know what happened to them. I hardly remember anything as I was thirsty and starving a lot those days. That's why I haven't grown that big as other cats. One day, a woman saw me and saved me from some dogs who were chasing me. I hope she saved my kittens too later. She took me to a place called Tomasina Cat Sanctuary, where they take care of stray cats like me.","Tomasina Cat Sanctuary is a non-profit organization that was founded in 1990. They have a big place in Qormi, where they host about 350 cats. They are entirely dependent on fundraising and volunteer support. They accept unwanted pets, kittens left motherless, sick cats, and stray cats who are in trouble. They also try to rehabilitate feral cats and kittens, so they can be re-homed.","They are very nice and responsible people who love cats and they do amazing work for them. They have a team of veterinarians who check the cats for any injuries or illnesses and give them the necessary treatment. They also spay or neuter the cats, so they won’t have any more babies. They have a network of foster homes who take care of the cats until they find their forever homes. They also have a website and a Facebook page where they post updates about the cats and their adoption status.","They took good care of me, even if I spent only a few weeks there. They put me in a room with some other cats, but I had my own cage because I was still in quarantine. They gave me some medicine and food. They also gave me a name: Lucky Candy. They said I was lucky because I survived the dogs and because I was very cute and sweet. They also said they already had a cat named Candy registered on their name, so they added Lucky to make it unique.","Later I got to know that my humans chose my name, Candy, after they'd seen me for the first time.","I was happy at the sanctuary, but I also wanted to have a home of my own. A home where I could sleep on a soft bed, play with toys, and watch the world go by. A home where I could get pets and cuddles from my humans. A home where I could feel safe and loved.","One day, my dream came true. Two humans came to the sanctuary and saw me in my cage. They looked at me with kind eyes and smiled at me. They asked the sanctuary staff about me and they told them my story. They said they wanted to adopt me and give me a home. I was so excited and nervous at the same time. I didn’t know what to expect, but I trusted them."]},p="_tomasina_cgm27_1",v="_heartbeat_cgm27_1",d={tomasina:p,heartbeat:v},b="/assets/candyattomasina-84204938.webp",T=m(`<div><object data="/src/assets/imgs/svgwaves.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object><h2></h2><figure><img alt="Lucky Candy's first picture in Tomasina Cat Sanctuary, she is standing adorably."><figcaption>The very first known picture of Candy.</figcaption></figure><p>And the rest is catstory.. thank you <a href="http://tomasinasanctuary.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TOMASINCA CAT SANCTUARY!`),k=m("<p>");function _(){return(()=>{const t=T(),y=t.firstChild,o=y.nextSibling,s=o.nextSibling,c=s.firstChild,l=s.nextSibling;return n(o,()=>i.first.heading),u(c,"src",b),n(t,w(f,{get each(){return i.paragraphs},children:e=>(()=>{const a=k();return n(a,e),a})()}),l),g(e=>{const a=d.tomasina,r=d.animate;return a!==e._v$&&h(t,e._v$=a),r!==e._v$2&&h(s,e._v$2=r),e},{_v$:void 0,_v$2:void 0}),t})()}export{_ as default};
