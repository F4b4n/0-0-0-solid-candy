It was not easy, but we had each other. We became friends and family. 🐈‍⬛</p><p>👩‍👧‍👦 Then one day, my humans came and adopted me. They gave me a new home, a new name, and a lot of love. They also gave me treats, lots of treats. 🥰</p><p>🎁 But they also told me that I should share my treats with my friends in the shelter, to thank them for being there for me and to help them find their own homes. They said it’s a way of giving back and spreading happiness. 😊</p><p>🙏 My business human often sends treats to my friends in Tomasina Cat Sanctuary, where I used to live. 🐾 You can also donate to the sanctuary via PayPal or a <a href="tomasinasanctuary.org/?contactUz=YES&amp;divSection=helpMe"target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">bank transfer</a> and help them provide food, shelter, and medical care for hundreds of cats in need. Thank you for being a cat lover! 😻</p><p>👏 My business human has been supporting the sanctuary since before they adopted me. They are very generous and caring. They want to make sure that every cat has a chance to be happy and loved. 💕</p><p>😍 You will make me and my friends very happy and grateful. You will also support the shelter and the amazing people who work there. You will make a difference in our lives. 🙌</p><p>🐾 Love, Candy 🐾</p><div><form action=https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr method=post target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><input type=hidden name=cmd value=_s-xclick><input type=hidden name=hosted_button_id value=WHDLVR5XVKMWE><input type=image src=https://www.paypalobjects.com/webstatic/en_US/i/btn/png/gold-rect-paypal-60px.png border=0 name=submit alt="PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!">');function h(){return(()=>{var e=s();return a(()=>t(e,o.treat)),e})()}export{h as default};
