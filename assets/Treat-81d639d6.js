It was not easy, but we had each other. We became friends and family. 🐈‍⬛</p><p>👩‍👧‍👦 Then one day, my humans came and adopted me. They gave me a new home, a new name, and a lot of love. They also gave me treats, lots of treats. 🥰</p><p>🎁 But they also told me that I should share my treats with my friends in the shelter, to thank them for being there for me and to help them find their own homes. They said it’s a way of giving back and spreading happiness. 😊</p><p>🙏You can buy me a treat via <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/luckycandy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">buymeacoffe.com</a> and my business human will share the treat with my friends in Tomasina Cat Sanctuary, where I used to live. 🐾 You can also donate directly to the sanctuary via <a href="http://tomasinasanctuary.org/?contactUz=YES&amp;divSection=helpMe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PayPal</a> and help them provide food, shelter, and medical care for hundreds of cats in need. Thank you for being a cat lover! 😻</p><p>👏 My business human has been supporting the sanctuary since before they adopted me. They are very generous and caring. They want to make sure that every cat has a chance to be happy and loved. 💕</p><p>😍 You will make me and my friends very happy and grateful.
