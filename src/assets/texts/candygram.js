  "I’m not crying, you’re crying. This is the happiest day of my life. I can’t wait to see this so called foreverhome even though I’m a bit scared. 😭",
  "I’m feeling a bit anxious in this new situation. It’s a bit scary and overwhelming, but I’m sure I’ll love it soon. I have a second chance to be happy and loved. And spoiled with treats and toys. 🎁",
  "This is my cave. It’s my secret hideout. I can spy on my new family and plan my next move. 🕵️‍♀️",
  "Who needs a computer when you have a toy like this? It’s more fun and interactive than any screen. 🖥️",
  "I’m not breaking into the TV desk. I’m just checking the security. It’s my job as a guard cat. 🚨",
  "This is how we nap. We cuddle and snore. We share our warmth and love. 😴",
  "Don’t judge me, I was just checking the trash bins for any leftovers. Old habits die hard, you know. 😅",
  "Posing is my talent. I know how to look adorable and photogenic when I sleep. I’m a natural star and a model. Everyone loves me. 😎",
  "I’m ready for my close-up. Draw me like one of your French girls. Make sure you capture my beauty and elegance. 😜 ",
  "I’m not cozying, I’m competing. This blanket is my rival and my trophy. I love to challenge it and beat it. 🏆",
  "Little did I know that I was about to get stabbed (vaccinated) shortly after this picture was taken. If I had known, I would have stayed behind the TV. But I guess it was for my own good. Vaccines protect me from diseases and keep me healthy. Still, it hurt a lot. 😿",
  "This is the consequence of getting stabbed (vaccinated). You feel so drained and weak that you can’t even raise your head. Thankfully I have this leg to lean on. 😪",
  "Today I did something amazing. I reached a big pot and stared at the plants and flowers. They had some secrets and mysteries. I was bright and fearless, like a superhero or a warrior. 🦸🗡️",
  "Zoomie time! 🚀 Tail, you're mine. 🐾 Missed. Try again. 😼 Scratchy ears. 😋 Tail hunt on. 😻",
  "Just woke up. Don't talk to me. 😾 Need coffee. Or tuna. Or both. 😋",
  "No worries about tomorrow, I’m living in the now. The world is beautiful from my window. 🐾",
  "This is me at the sanctuary, when I met my humans for the first time. They looked at me with so much love and kindness, I knew they were the ones for me.  I’m so grateful to them and to all the humans who help animals in need. They are the real heroes. 🙌🏻❤️🐾",
  "I know I look supercute in this photo, but don’t be fooled. I’m also superfast and superfun. Just wait until I get the zoomies and run around the house like a rocket. 🚀🏃🏻‍♀️🐱"
